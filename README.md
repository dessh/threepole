## About

Threepole is a clean, minimal Destiny 2 timer/tracker written in Rust and Svelte that displays stats about your current activity and clear history.

**If you want to use the overlay, make sure that you play Destiny 2 in borderless windowed or windowed fullscreen mode.**

## Features
- No sign-in required (your account needs to be public though)
- Non-overlay window for those who play in pure fullscreen mode
- Fast-updating and accurate API timer
- Displays your daily clear count
- Notifications displaying the results of your last clear
- Clean, unintrusive widget located above your minimap
- Easy-to-access configuration and account-switching
- Runs in the background and is manageable via the tray icon
- More features coming soon
